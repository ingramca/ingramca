Hi, my name is Caleb.

- I graduated with my first B.S. was in Mathematics (Applied and Computational option) from Oregon State in 2021, and I have recently been working to complete my postbacc degree in computer science. In June 2024, I will finally graduate! My professional portfolio will be up soon thereafter.
- Most of my programming experience comes from school assignments. I have used bash, C, C++, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Matlab, Python, R, SQL, and x86 assembly. The majority of my experience has been in Python, though I am excited to delve into lower level languages (C in particular).
- I am proud of the breadth of my STEM education. Computer science classes I have taken include data structures, web development, algorythm analysis, databases, operating systems, assembly language, network basics, network security, user interface design, and basics of UNIX/Linux. Math topics I have covered include abstract algebra, multivariable calculus, ordinary and partial differential equations, probability and statistics, stochastic processes, numerical methods, real and complex analysis, and linear algebra. Other STEM classes I have taken include biology, chemistry, physics, psychology, and mycology.
- In my personal life, I am excited about running -- my first marathon is scheduled in July 2024; reading -- I'm currently reading Slaughterhouse Five; and outdoor education -- I will be taking my 2nd tree climbing course in June 2024.
- I have been working for 3 years at Intel as a manufacturing technician. After graduation, I would love to apply my skills to work on restoration projects. I have particular interests in water management and forestry.
